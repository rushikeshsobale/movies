      <h2 class="text-center">DOCUMENTRIES</h2>
      <p class="text-justify text-white">
        <strong>A documentary film</strong> or documentary is a non-fictional motion-picture intended to "document
        reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education or maintaining a historical record". Bill Nichols
        has characterized the documentary in terms of "a filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of
        audience reception [that remains] a practice without clear boundaries".

        Early documentary films, originally called "actuality films", lasted one minute or less. Over time,
        documentaries have evolved to become longer in length, and to include more categories. Some examples are
        educational, observational and docufiction. Documentaries are very informative, and are often used within
        schools as a resource to teach various principles. Documentary filmmakers have a responsibility to be truthful
        to their vision of the world without intentionally misrepresenting a topic.

        Social-media platforms (such as YouTube) have provided an avenue for the growth of the documentary-film genre.
        These platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility. <br>
        Polish writer and filmmaker Bolesław Matuszewski was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. He
        wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema, Une nouvelle source de l'histoire ("A New Source of History") and La
        photographie animée ("Animated photography"). Both were published in 1898 in French and were among the earliest
        written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film. Matuszewski is also among the first
        filmmakers to propose the creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.

        The word "documentary" was coined by Scottish documentary filmmaker John Grierson in his review of Robert
        Flaherty's film Moana (1926), published in the New York Sun on 8 February 1926, written by "The Moviegoer" (a
        pen name for Grierson)

          <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Sachin: A Billion Dreams is a 2017 Indian documentary sports film directed by James Erskine
            and produced by Ravi Bhagchandka and Shrikant Bhasi under the banners 200 NotOut Productions and Carnival
            Motion Pictures. The film is a documentary on the life of Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. It captures
            Tendulkar's cricket and personal life in substantial detail, as well as reveals a few aspects of his life
            which have never been heard of or seen before.

            The film is simultaneously shot in Marathi, Hindi and English[8] and was released on 26 May 2017, along with
            the dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu.[9] This film was declared tax free in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh,
            Karnataka, Kerala, and Odisha.[10] The film fared mediocre at the box office.</p>

            Apollo 11 is a 2019 American documentary film edited, produced and directed by Todd Douglas Miller. It
            focuses on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, the first spaceflight from which men walked on the Moon. The film
            consists solely of archival footage, including 70 mm film previously unreleased to the public, and does not
            feature narration, interviews or modern recreations. The Saturn V rocket, Apollo crew consisting of Buzz
            Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins, and Apollo program Earth-based mission operations engineers are
            prominently featured in the film.

            The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2019, and was released theatrically in the
            United States by Neon on March 1, 2019. Apollo 11 received acclaim from critics and grossed $15 million. The
            film won a leading five awards at the 4th Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, including Best Documentary
            Feature. It also received five nominations at the 72nd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, including
            Outstanding Cinematography for a Nonfiction Program for Aldrin and Collins, winning three for its editing
            and sound.

            I Am Ali is a 2014 documentary directed by Clare Lewins. It covers the life of professional boxer Muhammad
            Ali. The film tells his story using personal audio recordings Ali made himself during the 1970s.
            Additionally, interviews of friends, family members, and people associated with professional boxing,
            combined with archival footage of Ali, are used throughout the movie. Notable appearances in the film
            include George Foreman, Jim Brown, and Mike Tyson.
            The American film critic Pare Lorentz defines a documentary film as "a factual film which is dramatic."[7]
            Others further state that a documentary stands out from the other types of non-fiction films for providing
            an opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it presents.[8] Scholar Betsy McLane asserted that
            documentaries are for filmmakers to convey their views about historical events, people, and places which
            they find significant.[9] Therefore, the advantage of documentaries lies in introducing new perspectives
            which may not be prevalent in traditional media such as written publications and school curricula.

            Documentary practice is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do
            with media devices, content, form, and production strategies to address the creative, ethical, and
            conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.

            Documentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.

          <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. Single-shot moments were captured
            on film, such as a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short
            films were called "actuality" films; the term "documentary" was not coined until 1926. Many of the first
            films, such as those made by Auguste and Louis Lumière, were a minute or less in length, due to
            technological limitations. Examples can be viewed on YouTube.

            Films showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the
            people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at
            over an hour and a half, The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight. Using pioneering film-looping technology, Enoch J.
            Rector presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.

            In May 1896, Bolesław Matuszewski recorded on film a few surgical operations in Warsaw and Saint Petersburg
            hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen invited Matuszewski and Clément Maurice to record his
            surgical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898.[11] Until
            1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films
            taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906,
            Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series
            Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées (1906), and the four-film Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne (1911).
            These and five other of Doyen's films survive.[12]


            Frame from one of Gheorghe Marinescu's science films (1899).
            Between July 1898 and 1901, the Romanian professor Gheorghe Marinescu made several science films in his
            neurology clinic in Bucharest:[13] Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy (1898), The Walking Troubles of
            Organic Paraplegies (1899), A Case of Hysteric Hemiplegy Healed Through Hypnosis (1899), The Walking
            Troubles of Progressive Locomotion Ataxy (1900), and Illnesses of the Muscles (1901). All these short films
            have been preserved. The professor called his works "studies with the help of the cinematograph," and
            published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of La Semaine Médicale magazine from
            Paris, between 1899 and 1902.[14] In 1924, Auguste Lumière recognized the merits of Marinescu's science
            films: "I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous
            illnesses, when I was still receiving La Semaine Médicale, but back then I had other concerns, which left me
            no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you
            reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way.</p>
