    <p class="container text-white text-justify p-2">
      <strong>INTRO_</strong>
      The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented.
      Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the Lumières quickly
      set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In
      each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local
      entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen
      additional product commercially.
      At its core, filmmaking is an art form that combines various elements to create a seamless visual and emotional experience. From the screenplay that lays the foundation for the story to the skilled actors who breathe life into characters, and from the director's vision to the meticulous work of editors and cinematographers—each component contributes to the final masterpiece. The art of filmmaking allows us to explore different cultures, eras, and perspectives, fostering empathy and understanding.
      Films are vessels of storytelling, capable of taking us on epic adventures, evoking laughter, tears, and contemplation. They have the unique ability to address complex societal issues, challenge norms, and inspire change. From timeless classics like "Casablanca" and "Gone with the Wind" to contemporary gems like "The Shape of Water" and "Parasite," films have left an indelible mark on our cultural landscape

        <h2 class="text-white text-center">HISTORY OF FILM AND INDUSTRY</h2>
        <p class=" text-white text-justify">
          <strong>The history</strong>of film chronicles the development of a visual art form created using film
          technologies that began in the late 19th century. The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly
          defined. However, the commercial, public screening of ten of the Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28
          December 1895, can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. There had
          been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others, like the Skladanowsky brothers, who used their
          self-made Bioscop to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895, in Berlin,
          but they had neither the quality, financial backing, stamina, or luck to find the momentum that propelled the
          cinématographe Lumière into worldwide success.
          The 1930s and 1940s are often referred to as the Golden Age of Hollywood. This era saw the rise of iconic stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Humphrey Bogart, and Audrey Hepburn, as well as the creation of timeless classics like "Gone with the Wind" and "Casablanca." The Hollywood studio system played a dominant role in shaping the global film industry.

            <p class=" text-white text-justify mt-3">The use of film as an art form traces its origins to several earlier
              traditions in the arts such as (oral) storytelling, literature, theatre and visual arts. Cantastoria and
              similar ancient traditions combined storytelling with series of images that were shown or indicated one
              after the other. Predecessors to film that had already used light and shadows to create art before the
              advent of modern film technology include shadowgraphy, shadow puppetry, camera obscura, and the magic
              lantern.</p>

              There would be no true motion pictures, however, until live action could be photographed spontaneously and
              simultaneously. This required a reduction in exposure time from the hour or so necessary for the pioneer
              photographic processes to the one-hundredth (and, ultimately, one-thousandth) of a second achieved in
              1870.
              It also required the development of the technology of series photography by the British American
              photographer Eadweard Muybridge between 1872 and 1877.

          <strong> A film genre </strong> is a stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures based on similarities
          either in the
          narrative elements, aesthetic approach, or the emotional response to the film.
          Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by
          "conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors". One can also classify films by the
          tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget. These characteristics are most evident in genre
          films, which are "commercial feature films [that], through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories
          with
          familiar characters and familiar situations" in a given genre.

              thrust into a series of events that typically involve violence and physical feats. The genre tends to
              feature a mostly resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds, which include situations, a
              dangerous villain, or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero.

              A comedy film is a category of film which emphasizes on humor. These films are designed to make the

              exception to this rule). Comedy is one of the oldest genres in the film and it is derived from classical
              comedy in theatre.
