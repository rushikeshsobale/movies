    <h2>ACTION FILMS</h2>
    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Action film </strong>is a film genre in which the protagonist is thrust into a
      series of events
      that typically involve violence and physical feats. The genre tends to feature a mostly resourceful hero
      struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a dangerous villain, or a pursuit
      which usually concludes in victory for the hero
      In Japanese cinema, the 1950s saw the emergence of jidaigeki action films, particularly samurai cinema,
      popularized by filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. His 1954 film Seven Samurai is considered one of the greatest action
      films of all time, and was highly influential, often seen as one of the most "remade, reworked, referenced"
      films in cinema. It popularized the "assembling the team" trope, which has since become a common trope in many
      action movies and heist films.

      <strong>The Early History</strong>
      Some historians consider The Great Train Robbery (1903) to be the first action film.[4][5] During the 1920s and
      1930s, action-based films were often swashbuckling adventure films, in which actors such as Douglas Fairbanks
      wielded swords in period pieces or Westerns. Indian action films in this era were known as stunt films.

      The 1940s and 1950s saw "action" in a new form, through war and cowboy movies. Alfred Hitchcock ushered in the
      spy-adventure genre while also establishing the use of action-oriented "set pieces" like the famous crop-duster
      scene and the Mount Rushmore finale in North by Northwest (1959). The film, along with the war-adventure The
      Guns of Navarone (1961), inspired producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman to invest in their own
      spy-adventure in the James Bond series, based on the novels of Ian Fleming.

    <h2>In The 1970s</h2>

    <article>

        style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
      <p class="text-justify"> <strong>During the 1970s </strong>, gritty detective stories and urban crime dramas
        began to evolve and fuse themselves with
        the new "action" style, leading to a string of maverick police officer films, such as Bullitt (1968), The
        French Connection (1971) and The Seven-Ups (1973). Dirty Harry (1971) essentially lifted its star, Clint
        Eastwood, out of his cowboy typecasting, and framed him as the archetypal hero of the urban action film. In
        many countries, restrictions on language, adult content, and violence had loosened up, and these elements
        became more widespread. In the 1970s, martial arts films from Hong Kong became popular with worldwide
        audiences, as Hong Kong action cinema had an international impact with kung fu films and most notably Bruce
        Lee films.[12] The "chopsocky" or "kung fu craze" began in 1973, with a wave of Hong Kong martial arts films
        topping the North American box office, starting with Five Fingers of Death (1972) starring Indonesian-born
        actor Lo Lieh, followed soon after by Bruce Lee's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972).[12] This
        inspired the first major Hong Kong and Hollywood co-production, Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon (1973). Lee's
        death the same year led to a wave of "Bruceploitation" films in Asian cinema, a trend that eventually came
        to an end with the success of several kung fu action comedy films released in 1978: Jackie Chan's Snake in
        the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master, and Sammo Hung's Enter the Fat Dragon.The success of Hong Kong
        martial arts cinema inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows starting in the
        1970s, and later the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television
        shows since the 1980s.[13] The first major American martial arts star was Chuck Norris, who initially made
        his film debut as the antagonist in Lee's Way of the Dragon (1972), before he went on to blend martial arts
        with 'cops and robbers' in films such as Good Guys Wear Black (1978) and A Force of One (1979).From Japan,
        Sonny Chiba starred in his first martial arts movie in 1973 called the Karate Kiba. </p>

        In the 1980s, Hollywood produced many big budget action blockbusters with actors such as Harrison Ford,
        Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lorenzo Lamas, Michael Dudikoff, Charles Bronson and Bruce Willis.
        Steven Spielberg and George Lucas paid their homage to the Bond-inspired style with Raiders of the Lost Ark
        (1981).[16] In 1982, Sylvester Stallone starred in First Blood, the first installment in the Rambo film series
        which made the character John Rambo a pop culture icon. That same year, the successful[17] action-comedy 48
        Hrs. popularized the buddy cop action subgenre, in which two police officers who are mismatched in personality
        and temperament, and often race and age as well, are forced to work together to solve a crime. There had been
        previous such films, including Kurosawa's Stray Dog (1949) and the American action film Freebie and the Bean
        (1974), but 48 Hrs. established a template that was copied by many other action films, including the Beverly
        Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon franchises, and later the Bad Boys and Rush Hour franchises. The genre has even
        extended to films that partner a human with a dog (such as the K-9 film series), and with a supernatural
        creature (such as the films Alien Nation (1988) and Bright (2017)).1984 saw the beginning of the Terminator franchise starring Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. This story provides one of the grittiest roles for a woman in action and Hamilton was required to put in extensive effort to develop a strong physique           The 1988 film Die Hard was particularly influential on the development of the action genre. In the film, Bruce Willis plays a New York police detective who inadvertently becomes embroiled in a terrorist take-over of a Los Angeles office building high-rise

          In Hong Kong action cinema, Jackie Chan developed into his own distinct style in the early 1980s, starting
          with the likes of The Young Master (1980) and Project A (1983), involving a mixture of martial arts,
          physical comedy, and dangerous stuntwork, including Chan performing many of his own stunts. This culminated
          in Chan's action-crime film Police Story (1985), which is considered to be one of the greatest action films
          of all time. It contains a number of large-scale action scenes with elaborate stunts, including a car
          chase through a shanty town, Chan being dragged along by a double-decker bus, a climactic fight scene in a
          shopping mall featuring many glass panes being broken that escalates to Chan sliding down a pole covered
          with dangling lights from several stories up, which is revered as one of the greatest stunts in the history
          of action cinema.
          In the film, Bruce Willis plays a New York police detective who inadvertently becomes embroiled in a terrorist take-over of a Los Angeles office building high-rise.[20] The use of a maverick, resourceful lone hero has always been a common thread from James Bond to John Rambo, but John McClane in Die Hard is much more of an 'everyday' person whom circumstance turns into a reluctant hero.[21] The film set a pattern for a host of imitators, like Under Siege (1992) and Sudden Death, which used the same formula in a different setting.

          By the end of the 1980s, the influence of the successful action film could be felt in almost every genre
