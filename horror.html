                <p class="mt-3 text-justify">Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience
                    for entertainment purposes.[2]

                    <strong> Horror</strong> films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive
                    topics or themes. Broad elements include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk
                    beliefs.

                    Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of
                    film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and
                    horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in
                    silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of
                    Dracula (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror,
                    slasher films, supernatural horror and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide,
                    varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of
                    Japan, Korea, Italy and Thailand, among other countries.

                    Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror
                    films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several
                    popular culture icons.

                        <strong>Nosferatu:</strong> A Symphony of Horror (German: Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des
                        Grauens) is a 1922 silent German Expressionist horror film directed by F. W. Murnau and starring
                        Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent
                        (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town.

                        Nosferatu was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram
                        Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel,
                        including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok. Although these changes are often represented
                        as a defense against copyright infringement,[3] the original German intertitles acknowledged
                        Dracula as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the
                        film was "a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences...setting it in Germany with
                        German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers"

                        <strong>BODY HORROR:</strong> A genre that emerged in the 1970s, body horror films focus on the
                        process of a bodily transformation. In these films, the body is either engulfed by some larger
                        process or heading towards fragmentation and collapse.[24][25] In these films, the focus can be
                        on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being overtaken, but the focus is generally upon
                        an individual and their sense of identity, primarily them watching their own body change.[24]
                        The earliest appearance of the sub-genre was the work of director David Cronenberg, specifically
                        with early films like Shivers (1975).[24][25] Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester
                        declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion, but also
                        pleasure and excitement such as in The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986)

                        <strong>FOLKROLE:</strong> is the whole of oral traditions shared by a particular group of
                        people, culture or subculture.[1] This includes tales, myths, legends,[a] proverbs, poems,
                        jokes, and other oral traditions.[3][4] They include material culture, such as traditional
                        building styles common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, taking actions
                        for folk beliefs, and the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas, weddings,
                        folk dances, and initiation rites.[3] Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is
                        considered a folklore artifact or traditional cultural expression. Just as essential as the
                        form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to
                        another or from one generation to the next. Folklore is not something one can typically gain
                        from a formal school curriculum or study in the fine arts. Instead, these traditions are
                        passed along informally from one individual to another, either through verbal instruction or
                        demonstration.[5] The academic study of folklore is called folklore studies or
                        folkloristics, and it can be explored at the undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. levels

                        <strong>NTR HORROR:</strong> Also described as "eco-horror", the natural horror film is
                        a subgenre "featuring nature running amok in the form of mutated beasts, carnivorous
                        insects, and normally harmless animals or plants turned into cold-blooded killers." In
                        1963, Hitchcock defined a new genre nature taking revenge on humanity with The Birds
                        (1963) that was expanded into a trend into the 1970s. Following the success of Willard
                        (1971), a film about killer rats, 1972 had similar films with Stanley (1972) and an
                        official sequel Ben (1972). Other films followed in suit such as Night of the Lepus
                        (1972), Frogs (1972), Bug (1975), Squirm (1976) and what Muir described as the "turning
                        point" in the genre with Jaws (1975), which became the highest-grossing film at that
                        point and moved the animal attacks genres "towards a less-fantastic route" with less
                        giant animals and more real-life creatures such as Grizzly (1976) and Night Creature
                        (1977), Orca (1977), and Jaws 2 (1978). The film is linked with the environmental
                        movements that became more mainstream in the 1970s and early 1980s such vegetarianism,
                        animal rights movements, and organizations such as Greenpeace. Following Jaws, sharks
                        became the most popular animal of the genre, ranging from similar such as Mako: The Jaws
                        of Death (1976) and Great White (1981) to the Sharknado film series. James Marriott
                        found that the genre had "lost momentum" since the 1970s while the films would still be
                        made towards the turn of the millennium

                        <strong>ATeen horror </strong> is a horror subgenre that victimizes teenagers while
                        usually promoting strong, anti-conformity teenage leads, appealing to young
                        generations. This subgenre often depicts themes of sex, under-aged drinking, and
                        gore. Horror films aimed a young audience featuring teenage monsters grew popular in
                        the 1950s with several productions from American International Pictures (AIP) and
                        productions of Herman Cohen with I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957) and I Was a Teenage
                        Frankenstein (1957). This led to later productions like Daughter of Dr. Jekyll
                        (1957) and Frankenstein's Daughter (1958). Teen horror cycle in the 1980s often
                        showcased explicit gore and nudity, with John Kenneth Muir described as cautionary
                        conservative tales where most of the films stated if you partook in such vices such
                        as drugs or sex, your punishment of death would be handed out. Prior to Scream,
                        there were no popular teen horror films in the early 1990s. After the financial

                        <strong> Psychological horror </strong> is a subgenre of horror and psychological fiction with a
                        particular focus on mental, emotional, and psychological states to frighten, disturb, or
                        unsettle its audience. The subgenre frequently overlaps with the related subgenre of
                        psychological thriller, and often uses mystery elements and characters with unstable,
                        unreliable, or disturbed psychological states to enhance the suspense, drama, action, and
                        paranoia of the setting and plot and to provide an overall unpleasant, unsettling, or
                        distressing atmosphere
